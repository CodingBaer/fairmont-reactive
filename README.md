# Fairmont/Reactive

[Fairmont](https://github.com/pandastrike/fairmont)/Reactive is a JavaScript library for functional reactive programming.

### In JavaScript

```javascript
start(flow([

  events("request", server),

  select(spread(function(request) {
    return request.method === "GET";
  })),

  select(spread(function(request) {
    return request.url === "/";
  })),

  tee(spread(function(ignored, response) {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.write("hello, world");
    response.end();
  })),

  map(spread(logger));

]));
```

### In CoffeeScript
```coffee
start flow [
  events "request", server
  select spread (request) -> request.method == "GET"
  select spread (request) -> request.url == "/"
  tee spread (ignored, response) ->
    response.statusCode = 200
    response.write "hello, world"
    response.end()
  map spread logger
]
```

## Introduction

### Iterators

An _iterator_ is an ES6 iterator, with a `next` function that produces a value wrapper.
A _value wrapper_ is what iterators produce, with `done` and `value` properties.
These are part of the ES6 standard.

An _iterator function_ is a function that returns a value wrapper.
This is an abstraction introduced by Fairmont/Reactive that allows us to leverage a functional programming style when using iterators.
Since iterator functions are isomorphic to iterators, we'll call them iterators for convenience when it isn't ambiguous.

### Reactors

An _asynchronous iterator_ is an iterator that produces promises that resolve to value wrappers.
These are a proposed part of ES7.
An _asynchronous iterator function_ is a function that returns promises that resolve to value wrappers.

A _reactor_ is Fairmont lingo for an asynchronous iterator.
Simiarly, a _reactor function_ is Fairmont-speak for an asynchronous iterator function.
Since reactor functions are isomorphic to reactors, we'll call them reactors for convenience when it isn't ambiguous.

When talking about values that could be iterators or reactors, we will sometimes say _producers_.

### Adapters, Filters, and Reducers

An _adapter_ creates a producer (an iterator or reactor) from a non-producer.
An _iterator filter_ is a function that takes an iterator and returns another iterator.
Iterator filters are just called _filters_ for convenience whenever it isn't ambiguous.

An _iterator reducer_ is a function that takes an iterator and returns a value that isn't an iterator.
Iterator reducers are just called _reducers_ for convenience whenever it isn't ambiguous.

When talking about functions that could be adapters, filters, or reducers, we will sometimes say _transforms_.

### Polymorphic Filters And Reducers

Most transforms are implemented for both iterators and reactors.
For example, if we pass an iterator to `map` we'll get back an iterator. Whereas if we pass it a reactor, we'll get back a reactor.
Similarly, if we pass an iterator to `collect` we'll get back an array.
If we pass it a reactor, we'll get back a promise that resolves to an array.

Many values that aren't iterators or reactors will be coerced into one or the other when passed to a transform or reduction.
For example, if you pass an array into `map`, the array will be coerced into an iterator.
Similarly, if you pass a promise into `map`, the promise will be coerced into a reactor.

## About Fairmont

Fairmont takes full advantage of ES6+ features like iterators (including async iterators, called _reactors_), generators, and promises. Inspired by libraries like [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and many others, Fairmont features include:

* reactive programming support through async iterators
* lazy evaluation on collection operations via iterators
* core functional operations, like currying and composition
* bridge functions for integrating with OOP-based libraries
* common file and stream based operations
* streams and event emitters modeled as reactors
* seamless integration between synchronous and asynchronous operations
* â€¦ and more!

## Status

Fairmont is still under heavy development and is `beta` quality, meaning you should probably not use it in your production code.

## Roadmap

You can get an idea of what we're planning by looking at the [issues list][200]. If you want something that isn't there, and you think it would be a good addition, please open a ticket.
